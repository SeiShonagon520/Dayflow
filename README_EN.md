## 🔐 Security & Privacy

Dayflow takes user privacy seriously with multiple layers of protection:

### Data Storage

| Data Type | Location | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Video Chunks | Local `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dayflow\chunks\` | Temporary storage only |
| Analysis Results | Local `dayflow.db` | SQLite database |
| User Settings | Local database | API Key, email config, etc. |

### Privacy Protection Measures

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📍 **Local First** | All raw screen recordings are stored locally only, full videos are never uploaded |
| 🗑️ **Auto Cleanup** | Video chunks are automatically deleted after AI analysis, saving disk space |
| 🖼️ **Minimal Transfer** | Only key frames (max 8 per chunk) are extracted and sent for AI analysis |
| ⏸️ **Pause Feature** | Pause recording anytime when handling sensitive content, resume when done |
| 🔒 **Local Database** | Analysis results are stored in local SQLite, never uploaded to cloud |

### Recommendations

- When handling banking, passwords, or sensitive information, click the **⏸️ Pause** button
- Click **▶ Resume** to continue recording when done
- Periodically check `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dayflow\` to confirm data cleanup is working properly

> 💡 **Note**: Dayflow's design philosophy is "local recording + cloud analysis + local storage". Raw videos never leave your computer.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project is inspired by [Dayflow (macOS)](https://github.com/JerryZLiu/Dayflow). Since the original project only supports macOS, I developed this Windows version based on the same concept, allowing more users to experience AI-powered intelligent time tracking.

Thanks to the original author for the creativity and open-source spirit! 🙏
